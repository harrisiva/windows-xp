# Windows XP
Vibe-coded web app with UI that gives a Windows XP vibe and offers some nostalgic features: pinball, Tetris, notepad, and paint. Also supercharged with a working AI chat through the nostalgic CMD.

Feel free to fork it, add more onto the AI slop, and send a MR if you have some dope ideas. 

Alternatively, create a new issue if you have an idea you want to see included.


# Setup
Make sure you have node installed and execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/harrisiva/windows-xp.git
npm start
npm start
```

## Classic XP Vibes

Got a FREE Gemini Key? Plug it into the shortcut and start chatting with AI through the OG CMD.
